            <h2>Make your choice</h2>
            <p>You will have almost 2 weeks to develop your portfolio project - during this period you will be alone or by team - to create a fully functional web application.</p>
            <p>Be before starting any coding, you will need to research and define the project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>LogIn Page:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Because it will end your pathway at ALX</li>
                <li>It‚Äôs summarize the entire Back-end specialization</li>
                <li>The weight of this project is important in your overall score</li>
                <li>You can be as creative as you want</li>
                <li>And the most important: <strong>You should be proud of it</strong> - it will be THE project to show off during interview</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Solo or by team?</h2>
            <p>Good question right?</p>
            <p>The first question you should ask yourself is: what I want to do?</p>
            <p>Front-end app? Mobile app? Back-end app? API service? e-commerce website? cloud platform for videos streaming? or better: a learning platform?</p>
            <p>Don‚Äôt be afraid to work in a team - ‚Äúmore resources‚Äù means bigger project - but also more soft-skills.</p>
            <p>Working solo is also fine - just don‚Äôt think too big or find quick-win to achieve your project.</p>
            <h2>No idea?</h2>
            <p>Be creative doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúcreate a web application that will make the world a better place‚Äù - no - it means: do what you really want: it can be applying concept your learn during the curriculum - it can be exploring a new technology (Go, Rails, etc.) - or make a clone of an existing platform (I was not joking about the learning platform or video streaming‚Ä¶)</p>
            <p>Try to solve a problem or learn!</p>
            <p>Also, a web application doesn‚Äôt only mean ‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù, it can also be just an API.</p>
            <h2>Steps of this portfolio project</h2>
            <p>To end the curriculum, the portfolio project is split in 3 parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The pitch (this project)</li>
                <li>The development</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ready? Go!</p>

            <h4>0. Pitch me your idea!</h4>
            <p>As mentioned in the beginning of this project, you have some questions to ask yourself:</p>

               <li>How do I want to build it?</li>

               <li>Do I like what I‚Äôm doing? </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you know these answers, you will have to prepare a pitch:</p>
